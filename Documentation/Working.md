### Project Documentation: Automated Message Sending Prototype

#### Overview

This project is designed to automate the process of sending personalized, witty messages to business owners, encouraging them to register their own domain names. The messages are generated based on the provided data and sent using the Twilio API for SMS communication.

#### Basic Structure of the Code

1. **Importing Libraries**:
    - The script imports necessary libraries, including `pandas` for data manipulation, `os` for directory handling, and `twilio` for sending SMS messages.

2. **Twilio Configuration**:
    - The script sets up Twilio configuration with your Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio phone number to authenticate and send messages.

4. **Loading Data**:
    - The script reads the provided Excel file containing business owner information.

5. **Generating and Sending Messages**:
    - Iterates through each row of the data, generates the personalized message, and sends it via SMS using the Twilio API.

6. **Saving Output**:
    - Ensures the output directory exists and saves the generated messages to a new Excel file for record-keeping.
